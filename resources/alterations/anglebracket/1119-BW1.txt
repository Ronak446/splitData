okay.
the little boy is out playing in the yard kicking his ball.
and it accidently goes into the plate, glass window.
and inside is a gentleman.
and the ball comes inside.
he sees the ball.
and gets up.
and sees the door, sees the window.
and the picture’s don’t show anything but I have a feeling that he went out in the yard and spoke to the son.
