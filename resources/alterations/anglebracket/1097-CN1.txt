but makes sense is on the pirst [: first] [* phon] picture she was the stepsister so she must’ve been taking taking, taken into a house with two ugly stepsisters and a stepmother.

and she was asked to work incessantly cleaning doing their clothes and doing the dirty work.

so well they enjoyed the easy life.

the king was having a, he decided to have a ball for the prince to meet the ladies.

and and the mother and stepsisters were invited.

believe Cinderella may have been too.

but she was forbidden to go.

and the sepsisters [: stepsisters] [* phon] and mother went to the ball and the party at the castle.

and well Cinderella was sulking a bit.

and her fairy godmother appeared and gave her the means to go to the ball and dress and the clothes and the charit, chariot.

and, but with one stipulation it would all go away at midnight.

so Cinderella made ut [: it] [* phon] off to the ball and praced [: pranced] [* phon] her pretty little self in there and danced with the prince.

and the he found her fascinating and.

but she had to leave and rush off.

and while she was running off one of her glass slippers fell off.

and then Cinderella made it home.

and her gown and everything else.

what I always wondered was her glass slipper disappeared.

but the one stayed complete with the prince.

the one hole in the story.

but wouldn’t work otherwise.

so the prince had the only this one piece of evidence try to look high and low and for the princess that could fit in the slipper, yeah slipper, shoe you know that stuff.

and and they finally the glass shoe fit on Cinderella.

and the prince knew he had found his princess.

and they got married and lived happerly [: happily] [* phon] ever after.
