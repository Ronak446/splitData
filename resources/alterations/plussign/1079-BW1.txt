Oh not so good
that happened with my children 
so this little boy he was playing with his soccer [: soccerball][* s]
 and he was just playing playing playing and then he was playing 
and then he, and he hit it 
and it went through the window 
and then of course the man, or the could be a person 
it hit the lamp 
and then he’s, it fell with the the lamp 
and the soccerball, was thinking about, he’s thinking that oh no my my, his soccerball came through the window
and he’s trying to figure out who hit that ball through the window
