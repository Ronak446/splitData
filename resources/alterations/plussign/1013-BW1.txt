There was a little there was a little ugh there was a little boy playing
Um outside 
And he was kicking a ball 
And the ball went accidently
Went hit the window of a house
And the the ball broke the window 
And went inside of the house 
There was a man in the house 
Was shrong
But a ball coming through the window
Then the man went to the window 
And to see who 
Man went to the window to see had
It is had ugh it is had 
The man the man went to the window 
And to see who 
The man went to the window 
And to see who hit his window with the ball
Guess
