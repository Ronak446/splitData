he brings home this old lady with two daughters.
and he tries to introduce her to the little girl and said hey this is gonna be your family.
then <the &h husband goes off> [//] or her father goes off.
he gets killed.
then all of a sudden she is treated like a slave in her own house.
and the mom is just doing everything for her two girls.
and they’re getting &r rather ugly.
and &uh I mean all the way around.
I mean looks as well as attitude.
so you have all that stuff coming in.
and Cinderella’s cleaning the house and cleaning this and preparing the food for them to eat every day.
and as she grows older she’s growing more beautiful every day you know.
but you know they’re getting uglier.
and warts are growing on them etc.
but hey one day <the prince decides he wants to get married> [//] or his parents decide it’s time for him to get married.
well he’s not too hip on that to have them selecting somebody for him to marry.
but all &th the people are getting together because they’re being invited to &uh dance in a formal at the palace.
but little girl has the invitation come to the house.
and the stepmom does not include Cinderella.
she’s only her two girls.
and the dresses they wear come from the dowry that her father had set aside that her mum [//] mom had wore years before.
and then she was left at home.
and she was doing this and all these little to do items just to keep her busy.
well she’s feeling so bad.
and then one day this fairy godmother pops up.
said hey Cinderella you wanna go to the dance.
oh I don’t have anything.
oh you got a piece of weapon [* u] over there.
&er &uh you know and she &way waves her wand and does all these things.
and there are four little mice that have been &n nibbling around things.
she turns them into horses.
and &oo there’s an old cat.
and he [//] she’s &uh one of the [/] &uh men on the side of the coach.
and the dog’s there too.
and she made him the driver of the [/] &uh the thing.
so all of a sudden you know everything is going.
and well we don’t have a coach.
and there was a pumpkin outside.
and she just did her wand and hit it and you know goes on.
this is a quick time right. 
but well they are all going.
and she’s &uh worried about how am I gonna get there.
don’t worry.
&tha that &zippity that &uh thing and &uh &bam on.
and there’s her ride.
it’s all ready.
the coach is the most magnificent one that attends the feast and everything.
and when she gets there but she said just remember you’ve got one thing you have to remember.
you must leave by twelve because everything turns back to what it was before I turned it into a coach and the &m mice into the &t beautiful horses and the cat and the dog were [//] won’t all be just what they were now.
so she goes off.
and she sees the prince.
and all these other people do.
and then he sees her.
and he comes chasing after her.
oh you have to dance with me.
and then they danced and danced.
and all of a sudden the clock starts to chime.
and what happens.
she starts running away from the palace because hey she knew I gotta get away.
I’m gonna lose my dress my shoes all this stuff.
but the glass <&scr &uh> [//] slippers that she had she lost one of them &o on the way running.
and then for weeks the people in the palace were hunting the young lady who lost the shoe.
whoever this fits I’ll marry etc said the prince.
so all of a sudden &bam what happens.
he comes to their house.
and she says oh my two daughters in here.
one of them’s foot is way too big.
and one they cram into it.
I mean they’re really trying to get it in there.
and it’s still way too big to go.
so and he says is there anybody else in the house. 
no one.
and then he [/] he says don’t you have another daughter.
and that’s Cinderella who’s down on the floor scrubbing it with a old brush because they didn’t have mops or anything like they do today.
so she’s doing this thing.
and next thing you know &bam she’s &t tries the shoe on.
and the man who represented the king and his family threw her in the carriage took her off.
and they were happily ever after.
