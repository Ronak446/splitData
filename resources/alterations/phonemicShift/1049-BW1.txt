this the ball the ball the man without kicking the ball.

and he kicked it so hard it went flying through the window.

cracked the big hole in the window.

came flying through the window.

and hit the man on the knee the knee, oh no cut his fingers on the lamp.

and the man got up.

and he picked up the ball.

and looked out the window at the boy.
