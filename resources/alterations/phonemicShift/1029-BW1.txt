okay the little kid was playing ball, soccer. 

and he's, he saw, or he he noticed, he hit it through the window and, and messed it up. 

and so dad was sitting on the, in the car, in the, in the chair. 

and it scared him and came, as it came through the window. 

and so he stood up and looked out and figured which kid he was gonna murdle, he was gonna hurt badly.
