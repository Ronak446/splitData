was a beautiful young lady.

and she, she had a parade of people that helped her, that that worked with her where she stayed.

and they didn't like her because she liked animals.

they liked they liked people that liked people.

and she was a she was a people person but she was an animal person.

she got along with all of them.

and she enjoyed talking to them and doing things they enjoyed doing.

she enjoyed doing that more than she enjoyed dealing with a lot of the old grumpy people that she had to work with.

so most of the time she would take her time and she would spend it playing with animals or the people that were around because she enjoyed that surrounding much much more.

and to make her day go easy she would do things they enjoyed.

and they would do things she enjoyed.

to make it go bad would be when she was with the people. 

and they did things that they wanted her to do or wanted somebody else to do. 

and she didn't like it and didn't want to do it she didn't.

and it made them, everybody unhappy about it.

and that's kind of the way Cinderella worked.
