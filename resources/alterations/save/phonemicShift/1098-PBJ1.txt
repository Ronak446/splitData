well first off I would start off by toasting the bread.
get a plate ready.
and I always take a knife and spread the peanutbutter on the bottom half of the bread. 
and then I'm guilty of using the same knife that going to the jelly jar, the jam jar.
and spread the jam over the other side of the bread and bring them both together.
