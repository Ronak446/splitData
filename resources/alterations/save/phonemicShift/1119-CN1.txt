well Cinderella was a very sweet little girl.
and she was sent to her stepmothers house who was a, the mother of two or three children who were horrendous to Cinderella.
and she was made to be a servant.
and she dreamed of a better life. 
and she was looking at the books of her past and her future in the attic.
and saw a pretty dress. 
and tried it on. 
and the two sisters tore the dress apart.

he was looking for a princess for his son.
and anyway she met her fairy godmother. 
and the, all the all the little mice dressed her up and made her beautiful.

and she went to the ball.
and there she met the prince who fell in love with her.
and she had to go home at midnight.
and she saw the clock getting ready to strike midnight.
so she flew down the steps.
and she lost her glass slipper when she did.
and his cortisone picked up the slipper.
and they all went about trying to find who who the foot, who could wear the shoe.
