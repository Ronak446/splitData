and then he had stepdaughters.

and then then he wasn't there anymore.

and so Cinderella had to be their maid.

and and she did everything.

and she she had to, she she tried having friends with the animals.

and then they were going.

they started singning, the sisters started singing with their mom before the the ball in the castle or whatever.

and she found the book that will tell them that they're, she had a dress that she could wear.

and then she went to the castle.

and she had a pumpkin that she can go to the ball or whatever.

so she had a good time with the prince.

she lost her shoe.

and then she came over back to the castle.

then it fit her foot.

and then they got married forever and ever.
I think.
