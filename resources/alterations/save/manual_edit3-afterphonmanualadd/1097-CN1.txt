but &uh makes sense is on the pirst [: first] [* phon] picture she was the &s stepsister so she must’ve been taking [/] &l taking [//] taken into a house with two ugly stepsisters and a stepmother.

and she was asked to work incessantly cleaning &uh doing their clothes and &um doing the dirty work.

so well they enjoyed the easy life.

<the king was having a> [//] he decided to have a ball &um for the prince to meet &um the ladies.

and [/] &s and the mother and &s &st stepsisters were invited.

believe Cinderella may have been too.

but she was forbidden to go.

and the sepsisters [: stepsisters] [* phon] and mother went to the ball and the party at the castle.

and &um well Cinderella was &m &s &s &s sulking a bit.

and her fairy godmother appeared and gave her the &uh means to go to the ball and &uh dress and the clothes and the &k charit [//] chariot.

and [//] but with one stipulation it would all go away at midnight.

so Cinderella made ut [: it] [* phon] off to the &um ball and &uh praced [: pranced] [* phon] her &s pretty little self in there and danced with the prince.

and the &uh &um &nilf he found her &uh fascinating and.

but she had to leave and rush off.

and while she was running off &sh one of her glass slippers &um fell off.

and then Cinderella made it home.

and her gown and everything else.

what I always wondered was her glass slipper disappeared.

but the one stayed complete with the &f prince.

the one hole in the story.

but wouldn’t work otherwise.

so the prince &w had the only this one piece of evidence try to look high and low and for &uh the princess that could fit in the slipper [//] &eh &um yeah slipper [//] shoe you know that stuff.

and [/] &um and they finally the glass shoe fit on Cinderella.

and the prince knew he had found his princess.

and they got married and lived happerly [: happily] [* phon] ever after.
