well first off I would start off by toasting the bread.
get a plate ready.
and I always take a knife and spread the peanut+butter on the bottom half of the bread. 
and then Iâ€™m guilty of using the same knife that going to the <jelly jar>, the jam jar.
and spread the jam over the other side of the bread and bring them both together.
