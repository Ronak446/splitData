okay.
little boy is outside. 
it’s a beautiful day.
he’s kicking a ball.
having a good time. 
then he kicks it again.
and it lands in that window. 
and this man is sitting on the opposite side. 
the ball comes in that window. 
he’s upset.
he gets up.
he picks up the ball.
and he’s standing there probably to yell at the boy.
and the little boy ran home.
