you have to get a loaf of bread.
take out two pieces of bread.
and you get the peanut+butter and the jelly.
and you start with the peanut+butter and spread it on the one piece of bread.
then you take the jelly and spread it on the the second piece of bread.
and then you close it or I don’t know how to say that.
just put the bread together with the peanut+butter and the jelly in the inside. 
and that’s how you make a sandwich.
