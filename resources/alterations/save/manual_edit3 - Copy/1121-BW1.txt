the boy is kicking the soccer ball.
the sun is shining through the window.
&hm &um &uh the soccer ball count [//] came inside and break the window.
so and so the man is looking out the window where the soccer ball came in.
and somebody will have face some consequences.
so on number two I think I did that wrong cause the soccer ball was coming in the window.
the man was catching the ball.
and he was looking out the window see where the ball came in.
is that good.
