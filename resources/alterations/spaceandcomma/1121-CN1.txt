well probably don’t remember as much as about that story as I should. 
but I, it was a a ball in the land.
and <the sisters>, she had two sisters that were going to the ball.
and she couldn’t go for whatever reason.
I don’t know.
and and they got dressed and went to the ball and left her at home.
and she had a fairy godmother that came and asked her <what she liked>, why was she was crying when she liked to go to the ball.
and of course she wanted to go.
and she she got dressed in a pretty dress.
and she didn’t have any shoes so the the fairy godmother gave her some slippers, golden [: glass] [* u] slippers.
and when she went to the ball she met a prince.
<and he> and he was all dancing with her.
and when midnight came he, she had to be back.
before midnight the <the slippers would>, no she had to be back before midnight because if not the slippers would thought <they would turn to something>, or she would lose anyway.
I don’t know.
but she was still at the ball at midnight.
and she was running away.
and she lost one of the slippers.
so the prince came and was looking for the one who, whose foot would fit the slipper.
and he was going to marry her.
and the evil sisters their fit, foot would not fit the slipper.
and when Cinderella <feet fit the slipper>, well the foot cause she only lost one.
when, when her foot fit the slipper then she went off and married him.
and she lived happily ever after.
