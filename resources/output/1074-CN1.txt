&um I know there’s like one other person there at that in that picture but &um.

but then there turned out to be more stepsisters.

but I don’t remember how many &um.

&uh there was a ball being held at the prince’s castle.

and she didn’t have anything to wear &um.

and then her a fairy godmother appeared.

and &um she got a dress.

and she got &uh the carriage and the &um &um glass slippers.

so she ended up going to the &um ball with the &um prince or he was there.

I cant remember which.

don’t know how that worked out.

&um but then &um she had to run away because the stroke of midnight.

I don’t think that was shown in the pictures.

but I know the story.

and so then um she lost her glass slipper &um.

and [/] and [/] so she only had one remaining slipper.

and so then <all her &s> [//] all the transportation and that went away.

so the prince went around looking for the owner of the glass slipper and she tried it on.

and &um he found the woman that he was meant to be with and they lived happily ever after.

I believe is what that’s indicated.
