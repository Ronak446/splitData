peanut+butter and jelly.

open the two containers of peanut butter and jelly. 

get me a I use a spoon. 

and I <pour it>, take it and dip it in the jar.

and get the peanut+butter.

put it on one slice of the bread.

and then get the jelly.

put it on the other slice. 

and then put the two of them together. 

and make me a sandwich.
