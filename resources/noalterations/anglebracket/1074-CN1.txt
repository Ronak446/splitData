I know there’s like one other person there at that in that picture but .

but then there turned out to be more stepsisters.

but I don’t remember how many .

there was a ball being held at the prince’s castle.

and she didn’t have anything to wear .

and then her a fairy godmother appeared.

and she got a dress.

and she got the carriage and the glass slippers.

so she ended up going to the ball with the prince or he was there.

I cant remember which.

don’t know how that worked out.

but then she had to run away because the stroke of midnight.

I don’t think that was shown in the pictures.

but I know the story.

and so then um she lost her glass slipper .

and and so she only had one remaining slipper.

and so then all her, all the transportation and that went away.

so the prince went around looking for the owner of the glass slipper and she tried it on.

and he found the woman that he was meant to be with and they lived happily ever after.

I believe is what that’s indicated.
