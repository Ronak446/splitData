well I do this every Sunday night. 
but I put a banana in my peanut+butter and jelly sandwich.
you get two pieces of bread.
and you spread peanut+butter.
and then you spread jelly.
I use grape jelly.
and you smash it together.
and I cut it in half.
and thatâ€™s how you serve a peanut+butter and jelly sandwich.
