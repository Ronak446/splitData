okay I would get a loaf of bread.
take two slices of bread out of it. 
then I would close it up. 
I would all, have gotten the peanut+butter and the jelly out of the refrigerator.
peanut+butter out of the cabinet. 
then I would spread my peanut+butter on one side. 
it wouldn’t have any lumps.
it would be nice and smooth.
and then I would take the jelly. 
and spread it on the opposite, on the other bread cause I don’t want to mix them.
and then I would make sure that didn’t have any lumps and it was just smooth as could be.
and if it was my peanut+butter sandwich I would put it in the oven to broil it for a little bit.
and then I would put them together when it’s nice and mushy and hot.
and then cut it in half and eat it.
