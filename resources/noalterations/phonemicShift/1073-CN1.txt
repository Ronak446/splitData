okay Cinerella  was young lady living with her sep mother .

where they call in the , ugly step momma and her two step sisters .

and the daddy died. 

and so she was the the, the sister was was always very mean to her .

so she had some little mice taking care of her and stuff and talking to her .

they made her a dress and everything . 

so the sisters tore the dress up . 

so the prairy godmother came and gave her a beautiful white gown .

and the white I guess a crown or something . 

and then she gaved her carriage on the , pumpkin . 

and she went to the ball . 

and she was dreaming at going to the ball looking at the castle and they wanted to go with to the ball .

so she did get to the ball . 

and she danced with her prince . 

and she said oh she had to go .

to eh truck, struck twelve at midnight .

she ran out the door . 

and one of ze slippers came off . 

so they was trying to find whatever . 

they just fit that other slipper, glass slipper .

he would marry her . 

so the step mother locked her in the room so she can try on the slipper . 

eventually I think the mice got her out or something . 

so she, the king say, gave her the slipper to try it on .

it fit and her and the pince got married .

and live happily ever hafter =laughs .
