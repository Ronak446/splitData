a little boy and, a young boy and a basethball cap was in tennis shoes was playing soccer and kicked the socco ball into the window in the house and broke the window.

and the soccer ball went inside the living room and hit a lamp.

next to the lamp was a a gentleman sitting in a in a chair.

and hard to believe his eyes he's looking at his broken window and outside and trying to determine who kicked this ball through the window and what am I going to do next.

the end.
