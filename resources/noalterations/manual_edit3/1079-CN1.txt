and &um his [: her] [* s] father &um he loved his daughter.
 <and &um> [//] but he got married. 
and there were two very &nn terrible ugly &um sisters. 
and &um [/] and the stepmother was very angry at Cinderella. 
&um so she would always do all the &chur &ch chores. 
and &uh but the two <daughters> [//] stepsisters &um <they could> [//] <they you know> [//] they enjoy what their mother.
her stepmother was a <very angry> [//] a &m mean person. 
and so &um anyway they had a [//] &um it was a ball from all over the land. 
and so they all had a [/] &um a note [: announcement] [* s].
but it’s not a note.
it would be like a announcement. 
and so everyone could go <to this> [//] to the castle. 
and so [/] &um so the [/] the [/] &ss the &um &ss &s stepsisters they were gonna have beautiful &uh &uh gowns for both of them. 
but Cinderella thought that she wanted to have a &um dress also. 
but &uh that [//] the stepmother said no you can’t go. 
&um you need to take care of the laundry and all <the &uh> [/] the &uh [/] broom [: sweeping] [* s] all of that.

and she went &poof like that.
<and then> [//] &um and it was beautiful you know. 
but then she well how am I gonna go and have a carriage. 
and they didn’t have anything. 
there were &uh mice. 
so the mice <were you know> [//] were gonna be like part of the [/] the men that help you know driving the [/] the [/] &um the carriage. 
and the carriage was really a pumpkin. 
and so the mouse then became people. 
and there was a horse. 
and <this was all you know> [//] they were part of the [/] the farm you know part of that farm area. 
and so all of a sudden the &s fairy mother [: godmother] [* s] said [//] &um she used her &w wand and went &poof.
and then everything was beautiful you know. 
she could get in the &s carriage. 
and she had this beautiful &uh dress and had &uh it would be glass &s &s &s slippers.

and then &um anyway she danced.

and everybody wondered. 
who is this woman you know. 
and she’s so beautiful. 
and so the prince wanted to &uh dance a lot. 
and he wanted to just be with her. 
and then at twelve o’clock exactly or almost it started &rin ringing. 
and &um &sh then Cinderella &reali realized that it’s almost twelve. 
and so she’s trying to get back to the pumpkin which is really still &uh a carriage. 
and when she was coming down the steps &um.
and the [/] the &um prince said don’t go. 
<you know tell me what’s> [//] you know &s tell me who you are. 
and she was &ss so fast. 
and she &um one of her shoes fell. 
and so she left. 
and I mean it [/] it was time.

and so [/] so here is Cinderella. 
<she looked like she use> [//] you know just she looked so sad and this &beau [//] no more beautiful &uh &uh &uh dress no nothing. 
and so well then after that <there was a> [/] there was a &um this [//] the prince wanted to find out where the &k slipper that was one left.
